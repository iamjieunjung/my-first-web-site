Transforming something strong into something superb thrills me.  Having found strength, I feel compelled to nurture it, refine it, and stretch it toward excellence.</p>
<p><strong><u>Input</u></strong>: Collecting things without any field limitation excites me. I collect information and such - because it interests you. I’m able to throw myself to research something new and such a task will surely amaze me because I can easily find the infinite variety and complexity of a targeted object.</p>
<p><strong><u>Strategy</u></strong>: My strategic perspective allows me to see patterns where others simply see complexity. I always ask myself “What if this happened? Okay, what if this happened?” and these recurring questions help me to evaluate accurately the potential obstacles and to make every possible scenario to prevent those.</p>
